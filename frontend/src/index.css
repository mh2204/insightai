  /* Re-defining provided colors like indigo-600 is usually not needed unless changing the shade, 
     but we'll add them to be safe if they were intended as custom specific shades. 
     The config had #4F46E5 which is standard indigo-600. #10B981 is standard emerald-500.
     So we barely need to define them, but for 'electric-blue' we do.
